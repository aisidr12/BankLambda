This is a similar application that i used while i was in the squad developing Lambda functions.

in order to test this lambda.

Just pull this branch.

- do a --> mvn clean package
- when its generated a jar file
- you can uploaded. Just remember this is done with JAVA 17.

- In lambda services in order to test, you can try with this input :

 {
  "amount": 2000000,
  "term": 24,
  "rate": 1.3
}
